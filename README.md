### Hello World! :earth_americas:

I'm Dale Toney from the USA.  I hail from LA :dark_sunglasses:, Indianapolis :corn:, and recently Chicago (:wind_face:!).  I am a recent computer science graduate :computer: (UMGC) and I am excited to utilize Spring Boot in my projects.  I have lots of app ideas and am always looking to collaborate.  Here is a little bit more about me :elevator:.
